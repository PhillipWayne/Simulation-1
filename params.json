I will continue to add features and fix bugs in time.\r\n\r\nWhat is this?\r\n---------------\r\nThe Simulation Framework is a sophisticated tool to write simulations and models. It can be used to simulate anything you can imagine from a simple GameEngine for a game or fully simulated scientific models / simulations.\r\n\r\nThis framework was written by me during my physics / informatics studies with the idea in mind I might be able to use it in the future. Also there might have been the idea to create a Simulator for the Atlantis city from Stargate :)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I use it?\r\n---------------\r\nThere is currently no documentation. However the code should be self-explanatory in most cases. Documentation will follow as soon as I get time to do it. To get started take a look into the Simulation.Testing folder. It contains a small console application to demonstrate its usage.\r\n\r\nHow can I contribute?\r\n---------------\r\nYou can contribute by telling me about bugs / feature requests you got.\r\nAlso you can fork it and make a push request to this main distro.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
