<p>An abstract multi threading enabled simulation Framework for C# that can be used to model / simulate everything you can imagine.
It is not in a fully finished / tested state at the moment. I will continue to add features and fix bugs in time.</p>

<h2>
<a name="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h2>

<p>The Simulation Framework is a sophisticated tool to write simulations and models. It can be used to simulate anything you can imagine from a simple GameEngine for a game or fully simulated scientific models / simulations.</p>

<p>This framework was written by me during my physics / informatics studies with the idea in mind I might be able to use it in the future. Also there might have been the idea to create a Simulator for the Atlantis city from Stargate :)</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-do-i-use-it" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-use-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I use it?</h2>

<p>There is currently no documentation. However the code should be self-explanatory in most cases. Documentation will follow as soon as I get time to do it. To get started take a look into the Simulation.Testing folder. It contains a small console application to demonstrate its usage.</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-can-i-contribute" class="anchor" href="#how-can-i-contribute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How can I contribute?</h2>

<p>You can contribute by telling me about bugs / feature requests you got.
Also you can fork it and make a push request to this main distro.</p>
